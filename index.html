						<p class="subtitle">
							My current role involves designing and supporting motor driver modules (inverters), both in terms of hardware and software aspects. I work closely with product development teams and assembly lines to ensure a smooth roll out.
						</p>
						<p class="subtitle">
							From the hardware aspect, I implement schematic and layout design, and collaborate with mechanical assembly. Sustaining hardware is a critical aspect in this role- dealing with events such as chip shortage and end-of-life components (EOL), plus any upcoming geopolitical news. Additionally, I have shocked myself a few times...
						</p>
						<p class="subtitle">
							From the software aspect, I focus on FPGA development, such as integrating newer hardware into our systems. In addition, I provide enhancements such as calculation improvements and system timing reduction to improve system performance. Ocasionally, I will write internal test tools in C, C++, Python and TCL to streamline development.
